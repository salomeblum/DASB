Slightly more than half Cabernet, a third Cab Franc and 10% Merlot, this definitely has the pedigreed vineyard fruit. The almost supernal softness of the wine suggests some sort of micro-oxidation, yet it remains sappy and tart. Flavors continue through a myriad of baking spices into a rich and extended finish. The only detriments: the acids are a bit chalky, and the finish lacks finesse. But it's a lovely bottle simply to drink.","Laurella",89,35,"Washington","Columbia Valley (WA)","Columbia Valley","Bordeaux-style Red Blend","Saviah",2.17639275076431,0.0285714285714286,4.45,"United States"
